        <h5>Department of Black Studies</h5>
        <br>
        Dear students,
We in the Department of Black Studies were moved by Thursday's walkout and sit-in at Frost Library. Initially an expression of solidarity with students at Missouri, Yale, and elsewhere, it quickly turned into an intense, fiery event, full of compelling stories of struggle, friendship, insistence on belonging, and an overwhelming demand that the institution change. Spoken directly to the Dean of Faculty, those words bore truths that are as old as the presence of students of color on campus and as new as the demands of student life today.
First, we want to recognize, applaud, and express the deepest respect for the courage it took to say all of that. To stand still with a strong voice and speak truthful things – that is no easy thing. We are humbled by your will to say your piece. Your demands to be heard and seen are righteous. Do not forget that. Second, we heard those demands as a department and we are reminded of how central they are to our mission. Your words remind us of our purpose here as teachers, fellow campus citizens, as a department, and comrades in the struggle for racial justice here at the College and in the wider world from which we all come.<br><br>
Racial justice on this campus, and this is true of the same in our wider world, requires full-court press. That is, our demands and conscience must press on everything and everyone who touches lives – faculty, staff, administrators, fellow students. That is exhausting work. We hope you all draw strength from those numbers in Frost. And as your work moves through its next phases, please know that we in Black Studies have your back.
<br><br>
In solidarity,
<br>

        <h5>Peer Advocates of Sexual Respect</h5>
        <br>
       Today we stand in solidarity with Amherst College's students, staff, and faculty of color and all students of color at colleges and universities across the nation that have felt threatened on campus. We are humbled by the strength and courage of those individuals who have spoken, and continue to speak, at the ongoing sit-in in Frost. Sexual Respect Education and the Peer Advocates of Sexual Respect support the goal of eradicating racism on this campus, both structurally and interpersonally. We recognize that all too often gender-based violence is also racially motivated and that the already harmful effects of sexual violence are compounded by the structural racism that further harms victims. We want to do our part in addressing that problem. To that end we strive to change culture around the intersections of race-and-gender based violence. This is only the beginning of an extended effort to address these problems, but we want to express our solidarity with student efforts towards changing these structures.

<br>
Dear friends of the WGC, MRC & QRC,
Today we stand in solidarity with Amherst College's students, staff, and faculty of color and all students of color at colleges and universities across the nation that have felt threaten on campus. We will be closing the Queer Resource Center, Multicultural Resource Center, and Women’s & Gender Center from 1-2pm to encourage you all to join us in Frost Library-1st floor for a sit-in. The Queer Resource Center, Multicultural Resource Center, and Women’s & Gender Center will re-open at 2pm and serve as a safe space for community building and discussion. We will have refreshments, wings and cider donuts.
<br><br>
In solidarity,
<br><br>
The WGC, MRC, & QRC
