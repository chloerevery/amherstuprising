        <h5>Letter from President Biddy Martin</h5>
        <br>
        November 15, 2015
 <br><br>
Dear Students, Faculty, Staff, Alumni, and Families,
 <br><br>
On Thursday night I attended a student-organized protest against racism and other entrenched forms of prejudice and inequality.  The sit-in was held in Frost Library.  It had started Thursday at 1 p.m. and there were several hundred people from all parts of the campus in Frost when I arrived from out of town.  The gathering of students continued throughout the day on Friday and into the evening and through the night.  Students have continued to gather through the weekend. 
 <br><br>
Over the course of several days, a significant number of students have spoken eloquently and movingly about their experiences of racism and prejudice on and off campus.  The depth and intensity of their pain and exhaustion are evident.  That pain is real.  Their expressions of loneliness and sense of invisibility are heartrending.  No attempt to minimize or trivialize those feelings will be convincing to those of us who have listened.  It is good that our students have seized this opportunity to speak, rather than further internalizing the isolation and lack of caring they have described.  What we have heard requires a concerted, rigorous, and sustained response.
 <br><br>
The organizers of the protests also presented me with a list of demands on Thursday evening.  While expressing support for their goals, I explained that the formulation of those demands assumed more authority and control than a president has or should have.  The forms of distributed authority and shared governance that are integral to our educational institutions require consultation and thoughtful collaboration.  When I met yesterday in my office with a small group of student organizers, I explained that I did not intend to respond to the demands item by item, or to meet each demand as specified, but instead to write a statement that would be responsive to the spirit of what they are trying to achieve—systemic changes that we know we need to make.  I also talked about why apologies of the sort that were demanded would be misleading, if not downright dishonest, suggesting, as they implicitly would, that I or the College could make guarantees about things that are much larger than a single institution or group of people.  Reacting immediately to strict timetables and ultimatums and speaking in the names of other people and for all times would be a failure to take our students seriously.  I was asked to read this statement to students today in Frost Library and did so at noon.
 <br><br>
Our students' activism is part of a national movement of students who are devoted to bringing about much-needed change.  They are exercising a fundamental American right to freedom of speech and protest.  Student protesters at Amherst have been threatened on social media with physical violence.  The College police are, as always, doing their job of keeping the campus safe.  And the administration will ensure that no students, faculty, or staff members are subject to retaliation for taking advantage of their right to protest.
 <br><br>
Amherst has committed itself to equal opportunity for the most talented students from all socio-economic circumstances.  That commitment involves more than assembling a diverse population of students. It includes a duty to provide a learning environment that is equally welcoming to all our students and one that is supportive of all students, faculty, and staff.  When staff and faculty of color leave Amherst because they do not have faith that they can thrive here, it is a serious loss for our students and for the campus as a whole, and requires greater attention to the conditions and cultures we need to change or to create. 
 <br><br>
The College also has a foundational and inviolable duty to promote free inquiry and expression, and our commitment to them must be unshakeable if we are to remain a college worthy of the name.  The commitments to freedom of inquiry and expression and to inclusivity are not mutually exclusive, in principle, but they can and do come into conflict with one another.  Honoring both is the challenge we have to meet together, as a community.  It is a challenge that all of higher education needs to meet.
 <br><br>
Those who have immediately accused students in Frost of threatening freedom of speech or of making speech “the victim” are making hasty judgments.  While those accusations are also legitimate forms of free expression, their timing can seem, ironically, to be aimed at inhibiting the speech of those who have struggled and now succeeded in making their stories known on campus.  The shredding and removal overnight of protesters’ postings, which were reported to me this morning, is, on the other hand, unacceptable behavior according to the student Honor Code. 
 <br><br>
Student protesters themselves are engaged in serious conversations about the importance of free speech and have asked themselves questions about uses of language that respect that freedom.  They are also asking themselves and us how the College protects free expression while also upholding our anti-discrimination policies and our statement of Respect for Persons.  Censorship and silencing are not the answer.  I believe our students know that.  It takes time, attention, and serious discussion to sort out and make clear how we protect free speech while also establishing norms within our communities that encourage respect and make us responsible for what we do with our freedom.  That is the discussion we need to have.  It must involve all members of the community—students, faculty, staff, alumni—and it must be the kind of discussion that reflects the traditions of Amherst and a liberal arts education at its best.
 <br><br>
We agree with the students that racism and other deeply entrenched forms of prejudice and inequality continue to affect our institutions and our culture as a whole.  And we acknowledge that our efforts to achieve a more inclusive and egalitarian environment are insufficient.  I could not be sadder about the pain that many of our students are feeling or more determined to meet their demand for change. We are committed not only to continuing the efforts we are already making, but also to stepping up the work that needs to be done in order to:
 <br><br>
1)   build a more diverse staff and faculty, with more aggressive recruitment and effective hiring and retention strategies;
 <br><br>
2)   support our faculty as they develop innovative ways of teaching our students;
 <br><br>
3)   ensure that faculty, staff, and students have opportunities and incentives to develop their analysis and understanding of the issues our students are raising;
 <br><br>
4)   acknowledge and support the work done by those staff and faculty who are primary sources of support for low-income students and students of color;
 <br><br>
5)   consider what messages our symbols send;
 <br><br>
6)   provide more opportunities for conversation, collaboration, and shared responsibility in the classroom and in residential life for students from different backgrounds;
 <br><br>
7)   make sure that students, staff, and faculty find a mix of physical spaces and opportunities for social interaction, some of which will provide comfort and familiarity and others of which will put us in a position that challenges us and guarantees our growth; and
 <br><br>
8)   as we did in response to disclosures about sexual assault and the College’s handling of it, establish a multi-constituency committee charged with studying issues of race and racial injury and making recommendations to the administration and the Board of Trustees. 
 <br><br>
This is a list of some, but not all of what we want to do.
 <br><br>
What is going on at Amherst right now is not at odds with our educational mission or an aberration from its course.  It is part of a struggle in the direction of greater awareness, understanding, and freedom from ignorance, prejudice, and narrow ideologies.  On urgent questions ranging from race to gender to war and peace, members of the Amherst community have been deeply engaged for as long as there has been such a community.  The complexity of the issues is challenging, yes, but also energizing at institutions like Amherst—which is certainly flawed, as any human institution is.  Like other colleges and universities, however, Amherst is also openly committed to getting better at what we do, for our students, for the larger society, and for the generations to come. 
 <br><br>
Sincerely,
 <br><br>
Biddy Martin

        <h5>Department of Black Studies</h5>
        <br>
        Dear students,
We in the Department of Black Studies were moved by Thursday's walkout and sit-in at Frost Library. Initially an expression of solidarity with students at Missouri, Yale, and elsewhere, it quickly turned into an intense, fiery event, full of compelling stories of struggle, friendship, insistence on belonging, and an overwhelming demand that the institution change. Spoken directly to the Dean of Faculty, those words bore truths that are as old as the presence of students of color on campus and as new as the demands of student life today.
First, we want to recognize, applaud, and express the deepest respect for the courage it took to say all of that. To stand still with a strong voice and speak truthful things – that is no easy thing. We are humbled by your will to say your piece. Your demands to be heard and seen are righteous. Do not forget that. Second, we heard those demands as a department and we are reminded of how central they are to our mission. Your words remind us of our purpose here as teachers, fellow campus citizens, as a department, and comrades in the struggle for racial justice here at the College and in the wider world from which we all come.<br><br>
Racial justice on this campus, and this is true of the same in our wider world, requires full-court press. That is, our demands and conscience must press on everything and everyone who touches lives – faculty, staff, administrators, fellow students. That is exhausting work. We hope you all draw strength from those numbers in Frost. And as your work moves through its next phases, please know that we in Black Studies have your back.
<br><br>
In solidarity,
<br>

        <h5>Peer Advocates of Sexual Respect</h5>
        <br>
       Today we stand in solidarity with Amherst College's students, staff, and faculty of color and all students of color at colleges and universities across the nation that have felt threatened on campus. We are humbled by the strength and courage of those individuals who have spoken, and continue to speak, at the ongoing sit-in in Frost. Sexual Respect Education and the Peer Advocates of Sexual Respect support the goal of eradicating racism on this campus, both structurally and interpersonally. We recognize that all too often gender-based violence is also racially motivated and that the already harmful effects of sexual violence are compounded by the structural racism that further harms victims. We want to do our part in addressing that problem. To that end we strive to change culture around the intersections of race-and-gender based violence. This is only the beginning of an extended effort to address these problems, but we want to express our solidarity with student efforts towards changing these structures.

<h5>Women's and Gender Center, Multicultural Resource Center, Queer Resource Center</h5>
<br>
Dear friends of the WGC, MRC & QRC,
Today we stand in solidarity with Amherst College's students, staff, and faculty of color and all students of color at colleges and universities across the nation that have felt threaten on campus. We will be closing the Queer Resource Center, Multicultural Resource Center, and Women's & Gender Center from 1-2pm to encourage you all to join us in Frost Library-1st floor for a sit-in. The Queer Resource Center, Multicultural Resource Center, and Women's & Gender Center will re-open at 2pm and serve as a safe space for community building and discussion. We will have refreshments, wings and cider donuts.
<br><br>
In solidarity,
<br><br>

<h5>Amherst United Left</h5>
<br>
Dear Amherst College students, faculty, staff, administrators, and alumni,<br>
The Amherst United Left stands in solidarity with students of color protesting at Missouri, Yale, Ithaca, Claremont McKenna, and right here at Amherst College. As an organization founded on decidedly anti-racist principles, we deplore the violence leveled against people of color across the world, and support the movement to dismantle systemic racism. We also lament the administration’s unacceptable silence on issues of race both in the wider academic realm and in our own classrooms and residence halls.<br>
<br>The Amherst United Left supports the demands drawn up by student organizers today, and aspires to serve as a resource, space, and organizing platform for students who have experienced oppression and/or desire to call for systemic change on campus.
<br><br>
In solidarity,
<br><br>

<h5>Amherst College Black Alumni Listserv</h5>
<br>
We, the members of the Amherst College Black Alumni Listserv, commend the students and student organizations that have taken peaceful action through the November 12-13 sit-in at Robert Frost Library and the ensuing list of demands put forth by Amherst Uprising to insist that Amherst "become a leader in the fight to promote a better social climate towards individuals who have been systematically oppressed".<br><br>
We urge President Martin and the Board of Trustees to hear the students’ voices and to take the necessary steps to ensure Amherst College is a campus of inclusion, from top to bottom: in its admissions office, in its classrooms, and hallways, and in all of the ways in which the College develops and extends value in it’s educational mission throughout the world.
<br><br>
Students of Amherst; we hear you, we support you, we applaud you.<br><br>
Sincerely, 
<br><br>

<h5>The Amherst College Department of English</h5>
<br>
Dear Students, Faculty, Staff, and Alumni,
<br><br>
We in the Department of English were moved and powerfully affected by the students of color and their allies who spoke at the Frost Library sit-in on Thursday afternoon, and by the continuing political action and engagement of the ‪#‎AmherstUprising‬ movement. The intelligence, emotional bravery, and sensitivity of Amherst students who have chosen not only to “stand in solidarity with black college students nationwide who experience the daily effects of white supremacy in academia,” but also to expose racism on our own campus and to demand change, is breath-taking and inspiring. Moreover, the call for change on campus they are issuing is important and timely.<br><br>
In response, the Department of English would like to voice our support for the #AmherstUprising campaign. Members of our community have expressed their pain and suffering in no uncertain terms. We stand with them and believe it is up to all of us to find ways to move toward healing and toward racial equality and inclusivity on campus. We would like to affirm our commitment to racial justice on campus and beyond, to raising consciousness about matters of race, and to redressing the long history of racial discrimination on campus that continues to have very real effects on all of us. We hope that as a community we can move toward a more authentic embrace of the value of diversity.<br><br>
As English professors, we believe in the power of art to open our eyes tothe human dimension in systems of power and oppression, and to offer prospects of a free life we might not have known before. An English professor’s response to a freedom movement will almost always be to hand you a book, to tell you about a play, or to recommend a film. In the coming days we’ll be posting titles of some of the works most important to us, including critical texts that we find to be among our most valuable tools and resources for nuanced thinking about race, power, and political change.
<br><br>
In Solidarity,
<br><br>
The Amherst College Department of English
<br><br>
<h5>The Amherst College Department of Physics and Astronomy</h5>
<br>
As faculty members in the Department of Physics and Astronomy, we have been moved by the anguish expressed by students at Amherst College. We admire and respect the courage with which many students have given voice, during the sit-in at Frost Library that began on November 12, 2015, to their painful experiences at the College. We join with the students and with colleagues in other departments and the administration to work with renewed urgency to understand more fully the conditions of campus life, and to take prompt institutional action to mitigate, if not eliminate, the sources of oppression that are disproportionately burdensome to students of marginalized identities.

<h5>The Amherst College Department of Math and Statistics</h5>
<br>
Dear students,<br>
<br>The outpouring of emotion at the Frost Library Sit-in has been intense and moving, and we greatly respect the courage needed to come forward to speak about your experiences. We, as a Department, are strongly committed to fostering an environment where students from underrepresented groups are supported, feel nourished and respected, and can thrive and succeed. We stand with you against bias and prejudice, and we hope that an open dialog on these issues will lead to a more inclusive community.
<br><br>Sincerely,
<br><br>Faculty in the Department of Mathematics and Statistics

<h5>Letter of Support from the Political Science Department</h5>
<br>
We in the department of Political Science write in support of the Amherst students who have organized the movement AmherstUprising. We share the students' hopes, aspirations and intentions of making our college as inclusive, tolerant and welcoming an institution as it can and should be.

<h5>Department of Religion</h5>
<br>
The members of the Dept of Religion write to support our students' emphasis on justice and their right to feel safe, and we appreciate their insistence that we recognize and seek to remedy all forms of discrimination and prejudice experienced by members of our community.
<br><br>
<h5>Department of Computer Science</h5>
<br>
Dear Students,
<br><br>
We support your efforts this week to highlight the ways in which the promise of Amherst’s commitment to diversity has not been fulfilled. Your individual voices have spoken powerfully about the continuing effects of racism in your lives. Both the College and its departments must do a better job of ensuring that students of every race and background have the support needed to thrive academically and to have full access to the opportunities here.
 <br><br>
Computer science is a field in which students of color are underrepresented, both here and nationally. This is a great loss, because our field needs all the talent that it can find. As a department, we will renew our efforts to provide an environment that welcomes and enables the success of all students.
 <br><br>
Thank you for telling your stories, for promoting justice, and for bringing together so much of campus in this cause. Your work will greatly strengthen our community for the days ahead.

<h5>Department of History</h5>
<br>
Dear Students,<br><br>

The Department of History supports the students in their quest for a more equitable and just society, and for the creation of a more inclusive community at the college. We have been moved, humbled, and inspired by the testimonies that students of color and their allies have shared in Frost Library over the past few days, and we take seriously their demands for addressing the various forms of structural racism, inequalities, and everyday forms of discrimination on our campus. We are committed to using our classrooms to engage with the broadest range of opinions and to better understand the entrenched problems of inequality in our society, which so often are the products of interwoven historical forces. We applaud our students for taking action on this important issue, and will continue to listen and learn as they shine a light on the struggles of marginalized people at Amherst, in the local community, and globally. This moment presents an opportunity to emerge as a more united community that values and reflects the diversity of experiences and perspectives within the Amherst College family.

<h5>The Amherst College Department of Art and the History of Art </h5>
<br>
Dear Students and Amherst College Community,<br><br>

We, the faculty of the Department of Art and the History of Art, write to support
#AmherstUprising’s efforts to bring racial equality and inclusivity for all marginalized students
to Amherst College.
<br><br>
We have been inspired by the students’ readiness to speak out against racial injustice, bias, and
prejudice. We recognize these courageous undertakings as creative acts: they seek to bring into
being new ways of seeing, doing, and knowing that would not otherwise evolve by ordinary
processes. It is our hope that the difficult conversations that students have broached will be met
with understanding and respect, and that these discussions will reverberate across campus to
effect needed change. We support systemic change at the College.
<br><br>
For our part, the recent events have already caused us to bring a more critical eye to the materials
and methods with which we teach, to acknowledge and incorporate a greater multiplicity of
experiences, perspectives, histories, and practices. We welcome this challenge.
<br><br>
Yours in solidarity,

We the Economics Department have been deeply saddened by the feelings of pain and
experiences of discrimination and marginalization expressed by students in the Amherst Uprising
movement, and we have been inspired by your courage and initiative in making your voices
heard. We share your desire to make Amherst a more inclusive, welcoming, and supportive

<h5>Letter of Support from the Department of Chemistry</h5>
<br>The faculty and staff in the Chemistry Department have been inspired by the courageous and moving testimony of our students during the events of Amherst Uprising. We are passionately committed to creating a safe and nurturing environment for every one of our students. We also understand that we have failed in this commitment in the past, and we promise to listen and respond to the concerns of every one of our students. We recommit ourselves to supporting the success of every one of our students, here at Amherst and beyond. We decry prejudice in any form, and we recommit ourselves to the ideals and full implementation of the Amherst College Statement on Respect for Persons, which reads:
Respect for the rights, dignity and integrity of others is essential for the well-being of a community. Actions by any person which do not reflect such respect for others are damaging to each member of the community and hence damaging to Amherst College. Each member of the community should be free from interference, intimidation or disparagement in the work place, the classroom and the social, recreational and residential environment.
In particular—and of particular relevance at the moment—we pledge that we will not tolerate disparagement or intimidation of any student or of any member of the staff or faculty in our classrooms, laboratories, offices, and common spaces.

We, the faculty in the Department of Biology, have been saddened to learn of the conditions that prompted the events of the past week, and inspired by the courage and compassion that students have shown in the discussion of such difficult issues. We are deeply concerned about the prejudice and bias that many of our students face, and how challenging this has made their experience at Amherst. The Biology faculty reject any form of discrimination. We are strongly committed to fostering an environment where all students feel supported. We realize that there is much learning and work to be done, but we look forward to a meaningful dialogue with our students, with a goal of ensuring our Department is a welcoming place for everyone.

Thank you for the vulnerability you displayed in bringing to broad awareness the impacts of racism and marginalization on your lives here at Amherst. We respect, value, and support the work you are doing. 
<br><br>We have also heard that we at the Counseling Center have work to do of our own.

<h5>Assistant Professors in the STEM Departments at Amherst College</h5>
<br>
Dear students,
<br><br>
We are writing to express our support for the students of color and those from other marginalized
backgrounds at Amherst College. We acknowledge the need for more moments in and out of our
classrooms for reflection, discussion, and personal testimony related to racial bias and
discrimination. We recognize that the administration must aid our efforts to improve in ways that
will allow us to best support you. Support mechanisms for students, faculty, and staff need to be
improved if we are all to accomplish the difficult task of removing racism and discrimination
from our campus, community, and beyond. As scientists, instructors, and mentors we are
committed to doing our very best in and out of our classrooms to support and stand with you and
to help remove all forms of bias and prejudice.

Ever standing in support, <br><br>
