        <h5>Department of Black Studies</h5>
        <br>
        Dear students,
We in the Department of Black Studies were moved by Thursday's walkout and sit-in at Frost Library. Initially an expression of solidarity with students at Missouri, Yale, and elsewhere, it quickly turned into an intense, fiery event, full of compelling stories of struggle, friendship, insistence on belonging, and an overwhelming demand that the institution change. Spoken directly to the Dean of Faculty, those words bore truths that are as old as the presence of students of color on campus and as new as the demands of student life today.
First, we want to recognize, applaud, and express the deepest respect for the courage it took to say all of that. To stand still with a strong voice and speak truthful things – that is no easy thing. We are humbled by your will to say your piece. Your demands to be heard and seen are righteous. Do not forget that. Second, we heard those demands as a department and we are reminded of how central they are to our mission. Your words remind us of our purpose here as teachers, fellow campus citizens, as a department, and comrades in the struggle for racial justice here at the College and in the wider world from which we all come.<br><br>
Racial justice on this campus, and this is true of the same in our wider world, requires full-court press. That is, our demands and conscience must press on everything and everyone who touches lives – faculty, staff, administrators, fellow students. That is exhausting work. We hope you all draw strength from those numbers in Frost. And as your work moves through its next phases, please know that we in Black Studies have your back.
<br><br>
In solidarity,
<br>

        <h5>Peer Advocates of Sexual Respect</h5>
        <br>
       Today we stand in solidarity with Amherst College's students, staff, and faculty of color and all students of color at colleges and universities across the nation that have felt threatened on campus. We are humbled by the strength and courage of those individuals who have spoken, and continue to speak, at the ongoing sit-in in Frost. Sexual Respect Education and the Peer Advocates of Sexual Respect support the goal of eradicating racism on this campus, both structurally and interpersonally. We recognize that all too often gender-based violence is also racially motivated and that the already harmful effects of sexual violence are compounded by the structural racism that further harms victims. We want to do our part in addressing that problem. To that end we strive to change culture around the intersections of race-and-gender based violence. This is only the beginning of an extended effort to address these problems, but we want to express our solidarity with student efforts towards changing these structures.

<h5>Women's and Gender Center, Multicultural Resource Center, Queer Resource Center</h5>
<br>
Dear friends of the WGC, MRC & QRC,
Today we stand in solidarity with Amherst College's students, staff, and faculty of color and all students of color at colleges and universities across the nation that have felt threaten on campus. We will be closing the Queer Resource Center, Multicultural Resource Center, and Women's & Gender Center from 1-2pm to encourage you all to join us in Frost Library-1st floor for a sit-in. The Queer Resource Center, Multicultural Resource Center, and Women's & Gender Center will re-open at 2pm and serve as a safe space for community building and discussion. We will have refreshments, wings and cider donuts.
<br><br>
In solidarity,
<br><br>
The WGC, MRC, & QRC

<h5>Amherst United Left</h5>
<br>
Dear Amherst College students, faculty, staff, administrators, and alumni,<br>
The Amherst United Left stands in solidarity with students of color protesting at Missouri, Yale, Ithaca, Claremont McKenna, and right here at Amherst College. As an organization founded on decidedly anti-racist principles, we deplore the violence leveled against people of color across the world, and support the movement to dismantle systemic racism. We also lament the administration’s unacceptable silence on issues of race both in the wider academic realm and in our own classrooms and residence halls.<br>
<br>The Amherst United Left supports the demands drawn up by student organizers today, and aspires to serve as a resource, space, and organizing platform for students who have experienced oppression and/or desire to call for systemic change on campus.
<br><br>
In solidarity,
<br><br>
Amherst United Left

<h5>Amherst College Black Alumni Listserv</h5>
<br>
We, the members of the Amherst College Black Alumni Listserv, commend the students and student organizations that have taken peaceful action through the November 12-13 sit-in at Robert Frost Library and the ensuing list of demands put forth by Amherst Uprising to insist that Amherst "become a leader in the fight to promote a better social climate towards individuals who have been systematically oppressed".<br><br>
We urge President Martin and the Board of Trustees to hear the students’ voices and to take the necessary steps to ensure Amherst College is a campus of inclusion, from top to bottom: in its admissions office, in its classrooms, and hallways, and in all of the ways in which the College develops and extends value in it’s educational mission throughout the world.
<br><br>
Students of Amherst; we hear you, we support you, we applaud you.<br><br>
Sincerely, 
<br><br>
Amherst College Black Alumni Listserv

<h5>The Amherst College Department of English</h5>
<br>
Dear Students, Faculty, Staff, and Alumni,
<br><br>
We in the Department of English were moved and powerfully affected by the students of color and their allies who spoke at the Frost Library sit-in on Thursday afternoon, and by the continuing political action and engagement of the ‪#‎AmherstUprising‬ movement. The intelligence, emotional bravery, and sensitivity of Amherst students who have chosen not only to “stand in solidarity with black college students nationwide who experience the daily effects of white supremacy in academia,” but also to expose racism on our own campus and to demand change, is breath-taking and inspiring. Moreover, the call for change on campus they are issuing is important and timely.<br><br>
In response, the Department of English would like to voice our support for the #AmherstUprising campaign. Members of our community have expressed their pain and suffering in no uncertain terms. We stand with them and believe it is up to all of us to find ways to move toward healing and toward racial equality and inclusivity on campus. We would like to affirm our commitment to racial justice on campus and beyond, to raising consciousness about matters of race, and to redressing the long history of racial discrimination on campus that continues to have very real effects on all of us. We hope that as a community we can move toward a more authentic embrace of the value of diversity.<br><br>
As English professors, we believe in the power of art to open our eyes tothe human dimension in systems of power and oppression, and to offer prospects of a free life we might not have known before. An English professor’s response to a freedom movement will almost always be to hand you a book, to tell you about a play, or to recommend a film. In the coming days we’ll be posting titles of some of the works most important to us, including critical texts that we find to be among our most valuable tools and resources for nuanced thinking about race, power, and political change.
<br><br>
In Solidarity,
<br><br>
The Amherst College Department of English

<h5>The Amherst College Department of Physics and Astronomy</h5>
<br>
As faculty members in the Department of Physics and Astronomy, we have been moved by the anguish expressed by students at Amherst College. We admire and respect the courage with which many students have given voice, during the sit-in at Frost Library that began on November 12, 2015, to their painful experiences at the College. We join with the students and with colleagues in other departments and the administration to work with renewed urgency to understand more fully the conditions of campus life, and to take prompt institutional action to mitigate, if not eliminate, the sources of oppression that are disproportionately burdensome to students of marginalized identities.

<h5>The Amherst College Department of Math and Statistics</h5>
<br>
Dear students,<br>
<br>The outpouring of emotion at the Frost Library Sit-in has been intense and moving, and we greatly respect the courage needed to come forward to speak about your experiences. We, as a Department, are strongly committed to fostering an environment where students from underrepresented groups are supported, feel nourished and respected, and can thrive and succeed. We stand with you against bias and prejudice, and we hope that an open dialog on these issues will lead to a more inclusive community.
<br><br>Sincerely,
<br><br>Faculty in the Department of Mathematics and Statistics
<br><br>

<h5>Letter of Support from the Political Science Department</h5>
<br>
We in the department of Political Science write in support of the Amherst students who have organized the movement AmherstUprising. We share the students' hopes, aspirations and intentions of making our college as inclusive, tolerant and welcoming an institution as it can and should be.
<br><br>Political Science Department, Amherst College
<br><br>
<h5>Department of Religion</h5>
<br>
The members of the Dept of Religion write to support our students' emphasis on justice and their right to feel safe, and we appreciate their insistence that we recognize and seek to remedy all forms of discrimination and prejudice experienced by members of our community.
<br><br>
<h5>Department of Computer Science</h5>
<br>
Dear Students,
<br><br>
We support your efforts this week to highlight the ways in which the promise of Amherst’s commitment to diversity has not been fulfilled. Your individual voices have spoken powerfully about the continuing effects of racism in your lives. Both the College and its departments must do a better job of ensuring that students of every race and background have the support needed to thrive academically and to have full access to the opportunities here.
 <br><br>
Computer science is a field in which students of color are underrepresented, both here and nationally. This is a great loss, because our field needs all the talent that it can find. As a department, we will renew our efforts to provide an environment that welcomes and enables the success of all students.
 <br><br>
Thank you for telling your stories, for promoting justice, and for bringing together so much of campus in this cause. Your work will greatly strengthen our community for the days ahead.

<h5>Department of History</h5>
<br>
Dear Students,<br><br>

The Department of History supports the students in their quest for a more equitable and just society, and for the creation of a more inclusive community at the college. We have been moved, humbled, and inspired by the testimonies that students of color and their allies have shared in Frost Library over the past few days, and we take seriously their demands for addressing the various forms of structural racism, inequalities, and everyday forms of discrimination on our campus. We are committed to using our classrooms to engage with the broadest range of opinions and to better understand the entrenched problems of inequality in our society, which so often are the products of interwoven historical forces. We applaud our students for taking action on this important issue, and will continue to listen and learn as they shine a light on the struggles of marginalized people at Amherst, in the local community, and globally. This moment presents an opportunity to emerge as a more united community that values and reflects the diversity of experiences and perspectives within the Amherst College family.
<br><br>
Sincerely,
<br><br>
The Department of History
