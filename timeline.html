<b>Thursday, November 12th, 2015:</b>
<br><br>
Three students organized a Sit-In in Robert Frost Library in solidarity with students of color at Yale University, the University of Missouri, and other similar institutions. At 10:40am, Catherine Epstein, Dean of the Faculty, sent out an email to all faculty members notifying them of the Sit-In and encouraging them to permit their students to attend.
<br><br>
At 1pm, students began trickling into Frost Library. Around fifteen minutes into the Sit-In, several students began speaking about how the Sit-In was a great motion of solidarity but wasn't enough to recognize and combat the racism on our own campus. Because President Martin was en route to Japan on college business, Dean Epstein read a letter on President Martin's behalf. While we do not have the letter that was read, President Martin's letter emphasized that she would pay the utmost attention to the racial tensions existing on campus once she returned from her trip.
<br><br>
Students were upset that President Martin was not on campus. The open discussion continued. Around 3pm, Dean Epstein notified all students present that President Martin cancelled her trip and would be returning that evening. At 4:04pm, following student demands, an email from Student Affairs was sent out to all students notifying them that the Sit-In was still happening and that all students were welcome to attend. However, classes were still not cancelled, so many students remained unable to attend.
<br><br>
Around an hour later, a group of student-representatives from fifty-four different affinity groups, clubs, and other student organizations gathered to create a list of immediate demands. Immediate in that they must be initiated within the next 24-48 hours and completed by Wednesday, November 18th. This group came to be known as Amherst Uprising. Throughout the four hours of planning, Amherst Uprising received advice from faculty members, administrators, and professors who all stood in solidarity.
<br><br>
While Amherst Uprising created the list of demands, the open discussion continued and the crowd grew, including members from each of the colleges in the Five College Consortium. The immediate demands can be found here. Both short-term and long-term goals are in the works.
<br><br>
Around 9:30pm, President Martin arrived. Amherst Uprising shared their demands with her. Amherst Uprising stated that they would be occupying Frost until the demands were initiated. A little after an hour, students were asked to document the event by taking pictures of the space and posting the images to different social media sites with the hashtags: #AmherstUprising #SitInSolidarity, and #RadicalCompassion. 
<br><br>
Additionally, three Amherst students came forward and declared a hunger strike. Amherst Uprising does not support the hunger strikes. When asked about their demands, the three students declared that they did not have any. President Martin immediately encouraged those students to practice self-care and to not harm their bodies. At one point, the microphone was taken from President Martin by one of those three speakers. President Martin promptly left. The three students have since issued a statement. 
<br><br>
The occupation of Frost library continued throughout the night. Food and drinks were brought in to sustain the students. Amherst College Police arrived to ensure the protection of the students.

<br><br>
In response to the events on Thursday, several professors dedicated their classes to discussing the Sit-In. Several professors even cancelled their classes. Other professors resumed classes as usual according to their syllabi. Some professors have argued they are willing to support but feel that they have a lack of access to the movement itself.
<br><br>
Because of that, at 11:00am, Amherst Uprising, comprised of students who spent the night in the library and others, met again to craft an email clarifying the immediate demands. Individual students reached out to professors and staff notifying them of the recent events and requesting their presence in the library.
<br><br>
Rick Lopez '93 (former head of La Causa) was scheduled to do a talk, ''Culture Shock to Culture Change'', in the McCaffrey Room in Keefe Campus Center for Life Stories. The talk was instead brought to Frost Library and the topic of student activism was heavily explored. More students began trickling in around 12pm as Rick Lopez spoke to the group.
<br><br>
At 1:11pm, an email, clarifying the demands, was sent to President Martin, John Carter (Chief of Police), Cullen Murphy (Chairman of Board of Trustees), Carol Allman-Morton, Elizabeth Anema (Alumni and Pair Programing), and Catherine Epstein (Dean of the Faculty).
<br><br>
Since then, several groups have either postponed or altered the content of their meetings and/or events, including but not limited to, DASAC, Marsh CoffeeHaus, interviews for the Career Center's Government and Non-prof Trek, and the ACSU's EXPO-Losion. Check with these groups for more information.
<br><br>
Around 3:00pm, President Martin requested a meeting with student organizers to discuss the list of demands and future steps.
<br><br>
Various media outlets have also reported on Amherst Uprising and the occupation of Frost, including The Daily Beast, Business Insider, NPR and The Washington Post. Other outlets have begun getting in touch with organizers and members of the movement.
<br><br>
On Twitter, there have been mixed reactions, with some voicing their support for the movement, and others critiquing it on the grounds of violating free speech. Some of these Tweets have been vitriolic and negative, including a death threat to participants stating ''Just shoot these kids for their own good.''<h5>
